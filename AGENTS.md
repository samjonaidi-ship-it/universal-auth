# Agent Workflow Contract | Bainbridge Builders | v1.5 | 2026-09-24 | BB

**Every agent working in this repo follows this file — Claude Code, Devin (cloud
AND desktop), Codex, and any future one.** It is deliberately IN THE REPO and
self-contained: a cloud agent cannot read anything on Sam's machine, so a rule
that lives only in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `C:\Users\samjo\...` does not exist as
far as it is concerned. Do not replace any rule below with a pointer to an
off-repo file.

## 1. Never push to `main`

`main` is protected on the active repos: a direct push is rejected with
`GH006 Protected branch update failed`. Even where protection is not yet on,
treat `main` as read-only. All work reaches `main` through a pull request.

## 2. One branch per task

- Claude / Codex: `agent/<task>` — kebab-case, task-named, not dated, not versioned.
- Devin: its own `devin/<id>-<slug>` naming is fine. Everything else here still applies.
- Rebase onto `origin/main` at the start of a session and before pushing.
- Reason about `origin/main`, never a stale local `main`.

## 3. Open a PR and let CI decide

Push the branch, open a PR, wait for the required checks. A red or **inconclusive**
build is not a pass — `cancelled`, `skipped`, `neutral` and `null` all mean nothing
was proven. Do not merge on them.

## 4. Who merges

**Routine changes may auto-merge on green.** Auto-merge is enabled on the managed
repos; it waits for the required checks and merges only if they pass.

**STOP and hand to Sam** — do not merge, say what you changed and why it is here —
when the diff touches any of:

- authentication, authorization, permission or role logic
- database migrations, or anything that writes schema
- branch protection, CI config, or the workflow files themselves
- credentials, secrets, tokens, `.env`, or key handling
- deploy configuration (Railway, Dockerfile, start commands)
- money: billing, invoicing, payroll, QuickBooks posting

If you are unsure whether a change is routine, it is not. Ask.

## 5. Clean up after yourself

When a feature is done: delete the branch (local and origin) and remove its
worktree. A merged branch left behind is a trap — the next agent resumes on dead
code. Note that a **squash-merged** branch does not read as merged by ancestry;
check the PR state, not just `merge-base`.

## 6. Never bypass a gate

No `--no-verify`. No disabling a lint to make it pass. No committing a suppression
to silence a check. If a gate blocks you, the gate is the message — fix the cause
or explain why it is wrong. (If a pre-push hook blocks a branch *deletion*, that
is a hook bug: a deletion pushes no content. Delete the ref via the API instead
and report the bug.)

## 7. The pull request body is the change record

Every change lands through a PR. Its body carries what changed, the evidence
(measurements, the real test output with its exit code, the CI run) and the
review trail. That body is the changelog entry — `docs/VERSION_MATRIX.md` and
`.session/TEST_LOG.md` are frozen (2026-09-02) and take no new entries. Render
the changelog from merged PRs with `node C:\Users\samjo\Desktop\Claude\TOOLS\changelog.mjs`.
Do not bump a "matrix version"; `package.json` carries the only version that runs.

## 8. Prove it

"Tested" means output. Run the repo's test command and quote the result, including
the real exit code — a piped command reports the pipe's status, not the program's.
"I wrote it but did not run it" is an acceptable thing to say. "It works" without
evidence is not.

## 9. If you run on Sam's desktop, stay out of the primary checkout

This applies to any agent with local filesystem access — desktop Devin, Codex,
Claude Code. Several agents share one clone.

- The repo's **primary checkout** (e.g. `C:\Users\samjo\Desktop\<Repo>`) stays on
  `main`, read-only. **Never `git checkout`/`switch` a branch there.** Another
  agent is reading those files right now; switching the branch under it changes
  its working tree mid-task.
- Do your work in a **worktree**: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<task> -b agent/<task>`.
  Keep worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` — sibling directories like
  `<Repo>-myfeature` work but hide from every cleanup sweep.
- Remove your worktree when the branch is merged. Do not remove one that is
  dirty or on an unmerged branch: that is someone's unfinished work.

Claude Code enforces the read-only rule with a PreToolUse hook. **Other agents
have no such hook — for them this section is the only thing standing between two
agents and a corrupted working tree.**

## 10. ADRs are not documentation — they are the CI

If this repo has `docs/decisions/`, those ADRs record invariants the codebase
depends on, and almost all of them are backed by a machine check wired into the
required CI job. You do not need to have read an ADR to be bound by it: the check
fails your PR and branch protection will not merge it.

- Before changing a seam — a client, a store, a schema, a DB access path, a
  layering boundary — read the ADR that covers it.
- Run the repo's architecture gate locally before pushing
  (`npm run check:arch`, or `npm test` where the lints are chained into it).
- **A failing ADR check is a decision to discuss, never something to route
  around.** Do not add a suppression, widen an allowlist, or rename a file to
  dodge a rule. If the invariant is genuinely wrong, say so and propose amending
  the ADR — that is a normal thing to do, and it is what §4 escalation is for.
- Adding an ADR means adding its check in the same PR. An ADR with no machine
  check binds only the agents that happen to load it into context — which, in
  practice, means Claude and not Devin.

## 11. Shared files are collision points

Anything every task touches — a root layout, a shared store, an index/registry, a
changelog — will conflict when two agents edit it at once. Rebase immediately
before touching one, and keep the edit as small as possible.

## 12. Before writing new logic, search for what already exists

The same helper gets written again in several repos when nobody looks first (a
phone-number normalizer, a money-to-cents converter, a distance formula). Before you
write a non-trivial function, parser, formatter or client, spend a minute looking:

- **In this repo:** grep for the verbs and nouns of what you are about to write, and
  read the `utils/` / `lib/` neighbours of the file you are editing.
- **The second brain, first.** Claude Code has the `mcp__brain-search__brain_search`
  tool (plus `brain_read` and `brain_inspect` to go deeper) loaded automatically —
  it is one call over docs, global memory, session digests, merged PRs, the wiki
  and code, ranked by meaning, not keyword. Codex reaches the same server through
  its own MCP config. Call it FIRST for "have we built / decided / hit this
  before" — before grepping this repo, before `embed-index`/`doc-graph`, before
  writing anything non-trivial. If the MCP tool is unavailable, the CLI fallback
  is `node C:\Users\samjo\Desktop\Claude\TOOLS\brain.mjs search "<question>"`.
- **Local agents on Sam's machine only** (Claude Code, Devin Desktop, dsh, Codex on
  the desktop) also have a by-meaning search over the docs and decisions, as a
  secondary tool once the brain has been checked. Ask it in a
  plain sentence; it needs Ollama running and says so if it is not:
  `node C:\Users\samjo\Desktop\Claude\TOOLS\embed-index.mjs search "<what you are looking for>"`.
  `node C:\Users\samjo\Desktop\Claude\TOOLS\doc-graph.mjs find <words>` is the literal
  (keyword) lookup over the same docs.
  For CODE rather than docs, the function index searches the top-level functions of
  every repo by meaning — describe what the function does, not what it might be called:
  `node C:\Users\samjo\Desktop\Claude\TOOLS\code-index.mjs search "<what the function does>"`.
- **Cloud agents** (cloud Devin included) cannot reach the brain or those indexes —
  they all live on Sam's machine — so do the in-repo grep and say in the PR body
  that the cross-repo search was not available.

**A brain hit is a lead, not proof, same as the other indexes below.** Open the
source and re-check it before relying on it or repeating it as fact.

**A search hit is a lead, not proof.** Both indexes are measured and modest: on a
14-query check the doc index put the right document in the top five for 8 of 14; on a
12-query check the function index put the right function in the top five for 7 of 12,
and it sees only functions declared at the top level of a file. A miss does not
mean nothing exists, and a hit does not mean it fits — open it and read it before you
reuse it or claim it does not exist. If you find an existing helper, use or extend it;
if you write a new one anyway, say in the PR body what you searched and why the
existing one did not fit.
